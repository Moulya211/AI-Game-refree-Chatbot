# AI-Game-refree-Chatbot
This project implements a Python-based AI Game Referee chatbot for a best-of-three Rock–Paper–Scissors–Plus game. The system validates user input, enforces bomb-usage rules, tracks state across rounds, and provides clear round-wise feedback before ending automatically with a final result.
